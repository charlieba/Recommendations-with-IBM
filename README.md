## Installation:
To run this project you have to use an instance of Jupyter Notebook with python 3. 
The libraries used for this project are:
* numpy.
* pandas.
* matplotlib.

Note: For the jupyter notebook file "Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb" you need to use the CSV "user-item-interactions.csv", and  articles_community.csv"

## Project Motivation
My motivation for this project was take the data provided IBM, about articles and user interactions and create a python recommendation engine.

The project include the next topics about recommendations engine in python: 
1. Rank Based Recommendations. 
2. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering.
3. Matrix Factorization

## File Descriptions
* **Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb**
The objective of this Jupyter Notebook is show all the flow and process with:
1. Rank Based Recommendations. 
2. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering.
3. Matrix Factorization

* **ML Pipeline Preparation.html**
HTML exporte from Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb.

## How to Interact with the project
All the project is located in Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb, the idea is navigate from basics concepts to all differents recommendations engine. 

## Results
The results and conclution can be finded in the file Recommendations_with_IBM.ipyn in the section V, matrix factorization.
